.. _installing:

Installing and getting started
------------------------------

To install the released version of seaborn, you can use ``pip`` (i.e. ``pip
install seaborn``). It's also possible to install the released version using
``conda`` (i.e. ``conda install seaborn``), although this may lag behind the
version available from PyPI.

Alternatively, you can use ``pip`` to install the development version, with the
command ``pip install git+https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn.git``.
Another option would be to to clone the `github repository
<https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn>`_ and install with ``pip install .`` from
the source directory. Seaborn itself is pure Python, so installation should be
reasonably straightforward.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Python 2.7 or 3.4+

Mandatory dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__

-  `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__

-  `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`__

-  `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__

Recommended dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  `statsmodels <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/>`__

The ``pip`` installation script will attempt to download the mandatory
dependencies only if they do not exist at install-time.

Unit tests aim to keep seaborn importable and generally functional on the
versions available through the stable Debian channels.  There may be cases
where some more advanced features only work with newer versions of these
libraries, although these should be relatively rare.

There are also some known bugs on older versions of matplotlib, so you should
in general try to use a modern version. For many use cases, though, older
matplotlibs will work fine.

Seaborn is also tested on the most recent versions offered through ``conda``.

Testing
~~~~~~~

To test seaborn, run ``make test`` in the root directory of the source
distribution. This runs the unit test suite (which can also be exercised
separately by running ``nosetests``). It also runs the code in the example
notebooks to smoke-test a broader and more realistic range of example usage.

The full set of tests requires an internet connection to download the example
datasets, but the unit tests should be able to run offline.


Bugs
~~~~

Please report any bugs you encounter through the github `issue tracker
<https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/new>`_. It will be most helpful to
include a reproducible example on one of the example datasets (accessed through
:func:`load_dataset`). It is difficult debug any issues without knowing the
versions of seaborn and matplotlib you are using, as well as what matplotlib
backend you are using to draw the plots, so please include those in your bug
report.


Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An unfortunate consequence of how the matplotlib marker styles work is that
line-art markers (e.g. ``"+"``) or markers with ``facecolor`` set to ``"none"``
will be invisible when the default seaborn style is in effect. This can be
changed by using a different ``markeredgewidth`` (aliased to ``mew``) either in
the function call or globally in the ``rcParams``.
